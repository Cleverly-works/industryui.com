##Â General

- [ ] Link for external Uris is not working that nicely with styled components - get undefined lastClassName on refresh
- [ ] Home Link is rendering unessecary gump and becoming default active - check snapshot

## Done

- [X] Need to handle the links containing mailto, call, tel etc
- [X] Turn the type mailto into a bool i.e. <Link to='s@s.com' mailto />
