# Blog

Service to collate all things related to construct a blog on a NextJS framework.

The blog is collated from a collection object. This object is created from
parsing all the documents within the Google documents folder.

```javascript
{
  category: 'Category',
  date: '2019-01-01',
  excerpt: 'Excerpt',
  heading: `Heading`,
  hero: true,
  slug: 'slug',
  tags: [ 'tag' ]
},
```
