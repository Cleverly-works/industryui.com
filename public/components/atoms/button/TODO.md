# Todo

- [ ] Probably should split the Toolbar into its own component folder
- [ ] Need to add the context, type and size from the constants
- [ ] Context should be a constants and oneOf
- [ ] Size should be a constants and a oneOf
- [ ] Check out the dynamic classes inline

## Done

- [X] Can just pass ...this.props to the component
- [X] Allow the content to be set by children or content
- [X] Allow the Theme to be passed in and utilised
