# DryKISS: IndustryUI

This is [DryKISS's](https://drykiss.com) react design system. It contains all of our components used
throughout our NextJS projects.

It enables us to rapidly prototype any type of site at any scale.

We are making this available to the wider community to experiment with at this time.
